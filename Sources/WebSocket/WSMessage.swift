     * Reads the body.  Here we can do a couple of things:
     * When a read is called, the reader can be either in "idle" state or in "reading header" state or in "reading payload" state
     * Here if a start is happening then we have to defer the "read" to when the start has finsished till we have data.
     * Once the reader is in "reading payload" state, we can have the following scenarios:
     * 1. The frame is a control frame, then just handle the frame and go back to reading again till the next two cases
     *    match.
     * 2. The frame belongs to a message that is new - so call the onMessage to begin handling of a new message 
     *    (this should get the message handler to start doing reads on the data which will come back through this path again)
     * 3. The frame belongs to an existing message (ie is a continuation):
     *    a. The message has outstanding read requests so serve it (and pop request off the queue)
     *    b. The message has no outstanding read requests.  At this point we can do two things:
     *       1. Buffer the data until we read frames corresponding to a message that has outstanding read requests.
     *          If there are no messages with read requests then dont buffer any data obviously.  Also if the buffer
     *          exceeds a particular threshold then the connection can just close with a 1009 response.
     *       2. Or just block until a read comes from the handler of this message and queues a read request.
     *          This is not a bad option since this way buffering can be done by the caller who may decide how much
     *          buffering to do (and in general buffer management can get messy).
     *
     * How to handle the first ever message?   When a connection is first created it has a stream from which reads 
     * and writes can be done.  This reader will be wrapped with a frame reader to return frames which is also nice.
     * However the frame reader will only be read from when a read on a message is invoked.  However a message cannot 
     * be created unless the frame reader has been read.   So a start on the frame reader has to be kicked off at some
     * time (or an intial read has to be kicked off) so that frames can start getting read and passed off to the message 
     * handlers for processing.   
     * 
     * One other scenario this can end up in is say if there are 5 messages being processed and neither of them have done a read yet
     * so on the connection there is a frame for a new message, since the read is not happening this new frame wont be read.
     *
     * Looks like both cases can be solved with a periodic read that happens in a loop (say every second or so as long as the 
     * read queue is empty)
